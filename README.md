# user_retention
Can we predict if users will return for another loan or not? 

From big corporations to small startups, companies are constantly aiming to improve their customer retention metrics. 

Using a Lending Club (a startup loan provider) customer dataset, we are interested in predicting whether the company’s users will return for another loan or not. To measure this, we assigned users into binary (0,1) groups depending on whether they had at least two active loans or used the service only once. 

The interest rate, grade, and monthly installments for the loan was used to predict if the user would use the service more than once. We could also dig deeper and take into account user zip code and income level, job tittle, or type of the loan (i.e. mortgage, credit card). 

We tested two models: logistic regression and naïve Bayes classification.
